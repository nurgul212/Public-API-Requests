### FSJS Project 5 - Public API Requests
In this project, I built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

- I used JavaScript to create an employee directory by communicationg with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).
